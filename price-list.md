# Note: 

You can get an extra servo motor as this makes coding much easier than the orginal car above, which uses a DC motor for turning and a potentiometer to determine what angle the motor is at.

## Note that Microcontrollers improve rapidly. 

Here is the changing list. The 2021 Portenta should last us a few years.   
(Any of the below materials would work fine, just we will be able to do much more with the latest equipment the Portenta and Vision Shield)

## 2021 Microcontroller Price List   
When we combine the PortentaH7 with the LoRa vision shield we have a great Machine Learning duo. But it is expensive.

$103.40 USD  The base best Arduino

$63.25 USD  allows the Portenta to See and hear and use the LoRaWan networks


The Portenta might need female headers if you don't want to solder wires directly onto it.  Here is a link if you want them. 
The male headers are good to attach the Portenta to a breadboard. Note: The female headers are attached to come up out of the board allowing the HD connectors below the board to connect the Vision shield to.
